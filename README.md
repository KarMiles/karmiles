### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I have recently completed a 1-year high intensity course in Full Stack Web Development. 

The training prioritized coding and involved building several web development projects. Some of them are visible in my public Github profile.

I have MSc in International Economic Relations from Kozminski University and Diploma in Full Stack Development from Code Institute.
